GrammarPy is an NLP project. Created this tool that checks grammar of web page URL given by user.

### Business Problem
Do you want to check the grammar of your website? If yes, first you need to collect the text content, then you can check it. But sometimes, it is not that much easy to collect the content from your website.

### Solution
GrammarPy's solution is using some web scraping techniques. It's enough to give it an URL as input, then it will check the grammar and will turn you some recommendations.
